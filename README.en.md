# OpenIPC-Tools

Some scripts developed specifically for [OpenIPC](https://openipc.org/).

## What do they do?

* `http-server.py`: HTTP server for local testing.
* `openipc-brute.py`: Login credentials cracking. The output will be messed up if you specify a host list parameter.
* `openipc-cmd.py`: Remote command execution. Not recommended for commands like `top`.
* `openipc-download.py`: File download. Direct download of binary files can be problematic.
* `openipc-get.py`: Get contents of a text file.
* `openipc-upload.py`: File upload. Not recommended for binary files.
